####Key Teaching Points

*	To save time we will be providing the solution file from Lesson 11 (in the exercises folder in the Students repo lesson 11 folder) and walking you through the app. This code along also serves as a review.



##Adding Devise 
####Time: 30 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ |devise, gems, documentation| 


####Key Teaching Points

*	Due to limited time, we are not teaching authenticaion from scratch. We want you to understand at a highlevel how authentication works, and so you'll be using Devise to automate most of the work for you.


*	You should learn how to read GEM documentation. In particular, learn how to open up a gem's GitHub page and figure out how to install / setup / use it properly.


__Suggesed Agenda:__

1.	Add Devise gem to the app
2.	Change "sign_in" to "login", and "sign_out" to "logout"
3.	Prevent unauthorized users from adding stories. 
	*	NOTE: Unauthorized visitors can still view and search for stories.
