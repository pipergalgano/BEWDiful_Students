OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for authentication and authorization on the Internet.

##OAuth
###Why Use It?

*	Easy sign up for your app through Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, LinkedInâ€¦or any other social media site that offers it.

*	Your app has access to lots of user information without giving you their password

*	Your user can revoke access from your app at any time.

*	You can use it instead of implementing your own authentication (e.g. with Devise)

##OAuth
###Providers

*	There are many OAuth providers in existence, you can use any of them (as long as they are open to use, and not private)

*	We will use Twitter's OAuth provider. To do this, we need to visit Twitter's dev page to learn about what we need in order to use it.

*	Visit [https://dev.twitter.com](https://dev.twitter.com) to learn more.

##Create a Twitter Application
###To use for OAuth authentication

*	Go to [https://dev.twitter.com/apps/](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/)
*	Create a new application. 
	*	For the Website, put your own blog. It doesn't matter this is a test. 
	*	For the call back URL, use ```http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/twitter/callback```

##Recap
###Export, Source

*	Prevent sensitive information from being posted to Github :-)

*	Source will execute the contents of a file in your bash session

		#inside your ~/.bash_profile
		export TWITTER_KEY=my_key                                           
		export TWITTER_SECRET=my_secret

##Recap

*	Used to access values from "middleware" parameters


		env['omniauth.auth]
