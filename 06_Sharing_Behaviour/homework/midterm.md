Back-End Web Development

##MIDTERM REQUIREMENTS

Create a command line based application that fulfills these criteria:

- Takes user input
-	Connects to any 3rd party API of your choosing where the call varies based on what the user gives you (e.g. in the WhiteHouse API call, we would pull from 'progress' instead of 'all' based on user input)
-	Must be object oriented. You must instantiate classes. The only file that can run without classes is your 'runner' file (e.g. in the teddit objects exercise, all the files in lib/ were classes, but the teddit.rb was a runner file and not a class itself).
-	Push code to your Github repostitory under 06_Sharing_Behavior/homework/midterm_#{YOURNAME}.rb.


##GRADING
Your midterm is considered completed if it meets all requirements above. Your instructor and T.A will provide you with feedback.


API Ideas:
* Reddit / Digg / Mashable as we did before are good examples, but use a different one of your choosing
* New York Times: http://developer.nytimes.com/docs
*	YouTube: https://developers.google.com/youtube/ (more complex)

##HINTS
* You can follow the reddit/mashable/digg exercise we did as a good example of how to make API calls.
* Then, extend that to take user input.
* Add Classes to organize your code better, and put them in their own files
* Lastly, make your runner file import your other classes

This midterm is due July 9th, so you have lots of time to work on it. Still, do not leave it until the last minute. Make sure you start early, seek help if needed, and attend office hours to get feedback if necessary.

Good luck!
