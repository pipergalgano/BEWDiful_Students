LESSON 14: Final Project: Getting Started
========


LEARNING OBJECTIVES
--------


We want to give students tools to conceptualize and plan their final project. We hope that this will lead to everyone completing their project.

This lesson, students will:

*	Create user stories to help them define functionality.

*	Create wire frames of views based on user stories to better conceptualize what they want their app to accomplish.

*	Diagram database schemas.

| 30 min | Draw Wire Frames / Paper Prototypes | [Rapid Prototype Your App - Wire Frames](exercises/readme.md )|  | 
| 45 min | User Testing | [Rapid Prototype Your App - User Testing](exercises/readme.md) | Students test a few of their wireframes with 2 other students. |

HOMEWORK
--------

Due Lesson 15:

*	At least 5 User Stories.
*	Diagram of database schema (models, attributes for those models, associations).

This milestone is a great way for you to identify major hurdles in a project before students begin to code.
